# Fooling_Classifiers_and_Localization
This repository contains code snippets and theoretical discussions for two related tasks: fooling classifiers and object localization using deep learning techniques.

## Part 1 - Fooling Classifiers
In this section, we explore how to manipulate input images to deceive deep learning classifiers. The code demonstrates how to generate fooling images by iteratively modifying pixel values to maximize the probability of a target class while minimizing others. Theoretical discussions delve into the implications of fooling images for model reliability and the differences between human and machine vision.

## Part 2 - Localization as Regression
The second part focuses on utilizing a pretrained ResNet18 model for object localization and classification. By fine-tuning the model and incorporating additional layers, we create a CNN capable of localizing and classifying images of cats and dogs. Discussions cover topics such as model evaluation metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) and strategies for improving model performance.
